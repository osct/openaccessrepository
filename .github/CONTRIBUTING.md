# Contributing

We are really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this documentation encompass all of its goals and be understandable to those who use it.

If you would like to discuss issues or ideas, please take a look at the [African e-Infrastructures Forum](http://discourse.sci-gaia.eu), and please feel free to introduce yourself there, as well as highlight issues.

Here are some important resources:

## Testing

We do not yet test the documentation build, however we plan to use Travis to check the validity of pull requests.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to the repo](https://github.com/osct/openaccessrepository/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Documentation conventions

  1. Documentation should be written in Restructured Text
  2. Chapters should  be included by name of file in the index.rst main file
  3. Chapters should have the naming convention `oar-<name of chapter>.rst`
